     * south neighbors differ, the cell becomes inactive; if exactly two neighbors are active and form a corner
     * (e.g., north and west), the cell becomes inactive (erase corners); if they form a straight line (e.g., north
     * and south), the cell becomes active (fill pockets); otherwise, the cell remains unchanged. This shapes patterns
     * to support computing circuitry.
