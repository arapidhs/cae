# Cellular Automata Simulator

A Java-based terminal application for simulating and visualizing cellular automata. The simulator supports various automaton configurations, with interactive controls and customizable visualizations.

## Features

- Multiple automata configurations, including Conway's Game of Life, HGLASS, and Inkspot.
- Interactive terminal interface using Lanterna, with keyboard and mouse controls (e.g., pause, step, zoom).
- Dynamic visualizations with state transition feedback (e.g., echo and tracing effects).
- Flexible grid initialization (random or centered blobs) and adjustable update intervals.
- Extensible architecture with modular rules, initializers, and renderers.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8.x or higher
- Git
